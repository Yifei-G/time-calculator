# Time-calculator

## Level of difficulty

Medium

## Objectives

1. Improving the student's skills in operating with special methods

## Scenario
1. Create a class representing a time interval;

2. The class should implement its own method for addition, subtraction on time interval class objects;

3. The class should implement its own method for multiplication of time interval class objects by an integer-type value;

4. The __init__ method should be based on keywords to allow accurate and convenient object initialization, but limit it to hours, minutes, and seconds parameters;

5. The __str__ method should return an HH:MM:SS string, where HH represents hours, MM represents minutes and SS represents the seconds attributes of the time interval object;
   Check the argument type, and in case of a mismatch, raise a TypeError exception.

## Extra:

1.  Extend the class implementation prepared in the previous lab to support the addition and subtraction of integers to time interval objects;
2.  To add an integer to a time interval object means to add seconds;
3.  To subtract an integer from a time interval object means to remove seconds.
